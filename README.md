# CUDA Reduction-Norm2 Comparison

 `norm2` and  `reduction` are important building block of linear algebra, which is often used to obtain the length of a vector.

This project compares three types of reduction strategies plus the `norm2` function used in the [Bridge++ Lattice QCD framework](https://bridge.kek.jp/Lattice-code/).

## Implemented Methods

### 1. Harris-Style Reduction + Norm2
The first method is based on the well-known CUDA reduction techniques introduced by Mark Harris ([PDF link](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf)).  
All optimization strategies described in the paper are implemented, except for the "Idle Threads" mitigation.  
### üîÅ **Execution Flow**

`norm2` ‚û°Ô∏è `multi-block reduction` ‚û°Ô∏è `final single-block reduction`

### 2. Fused Kernel (Norm2 + Partial Reduction)
The second method fuses the `norm2` computation and per-block reduction into a single kernel, followed by a final single-block reduction kernel.  
This reduces kernel launch overhead and improves memory locality.

### üîÅ **Execution Flow**

`norm2+multi-block reduction fused kernel` ‚û°Ô∏è `final single-block reduction`


### 3. Separate Norm2 + Single Reduction
The third method performs `norm2` followed by a single reduction kernel over the entire result buffer, which is the orign style in Bridge++

### üîÅ **Execution Flow**

`norm2` ‚û°Ô∏è `Single-block reduction`
